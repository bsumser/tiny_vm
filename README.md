## Description
This is my implementation of the Quack language compiler for CS 461.


## Installation
This repo includes a script titled "quack.sh" for easy compilation. To run, use:

```console
./quack.sh "file.qk"
```

There is a directory titled "test_progs" which contains a sample of working Quack programs.
